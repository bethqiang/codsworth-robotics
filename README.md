Need a robot butler? We've got you covered.

## A Note

This project was originally built during my Senior Phase of [Fullstack Academy](https://www.fullstackacademy.com/) in conjunction with [Joey Darbyshire](https://github.com/Jmikeydarby) and [Mark Hario](https://github.com/mhario). Our original repository with a live demo link can be found [here](https://github.com/Codsworth-Robotics/codsworth-robotics). When Fullstack ended, I decided to revisit this project and expand upon the work we did, and the results of my efforts are contained within this repository.

## Live Demo

An online build of Codsworth Robotics can be found [here](https://codsworthrobotics.herokuapp.com/).

## Architecture

Codsworth Robotics is built on [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), [Express](http://expressjs.com/), [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/), and [Sequelize](http://docs.sequelizejs.com/en/v3/) on the back-end, and [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), [Redux](http://redux.js.org/), and [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) on the front-end.
